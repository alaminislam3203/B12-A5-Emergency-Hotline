## 2. How do you create and insert a new element in the DOM?

- Use document.createElement() to create a new element.
- Then use appendChild(), append(), prepend(), or insertBefore() to add it to the DOM.

## 3. What is event bubbling and how does it work?

- Event bubbling is a part of DOM event propagation.
- When an event occurs on a child element, it first triggers on the child, then moves to the parent, and then propagates upwards through more parent elements. 
- The event rises upward "like a bubble" from bottom to top. 



## 4. What is event delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

- Event delegation is placing an event listener on a parent element so that the events of child elements can be handled together.
- Because of event bubbling, the child element's event reaches the parent. That‚Äôs why we can place a listener on the parent and control the events of the child elements.

 

**Why is it useful?**
- Even with many child elements, only one listener is needed. 
- Performance improves, and the code becomes cleaner.
- Can handle events of dynamically created child elements.

## 5.What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()?

- **preventDefault()**  
  - Stops the default behavior of an element. 
  - For example, prevents form submission or page reload when clicking a link.


- **stopPropagation()**  
  - Stops the propagation of the event.
  - Meaning event bubbling (child ‚Üí parent) or capturing (parent ‚Üí child) no longer continues.
